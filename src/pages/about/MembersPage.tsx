                BNF Members are those who have proven their commitment to the BNF by contributing to
                one or more of the Foundation’s projects. We thank them for their ongoing
                contributions to the Foundation.

                Our Members are similar to stockholders–they elect new Members and may vote for
                Directors. Membership in The BiblioNexus Foundation is a privilege and is by
                invitation only. The <a href='/foundation/governance/'>Governance</a> page provides
                details on Membership and the nomination process.
