            <p>Ethos:</p>
            <p>
                BiblioNexus Studio treats each of our partner’s software product ideas as though it
                were our own startup, like a co-founder. We strive to deeply understand our
                partner’s target market and users in order to increase the likelihood of achieving
                product-market fit and the product’s ultimate success. We measure our success in the
                same way our partners measure theirs i.e. accelerating achievement of the All Access
                Goals (AAGs). And we use each experience to improve internal processes and advance
                our knowledge of product-market fit. Then, we apply this craft when building our
                next partner’s product. Thus, investments made in BiblioNexus Studio deliver ROI not
                just for the product-at-hand, but cumulatively over time and over many software
                products in a powerful and reusable way.
