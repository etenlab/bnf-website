                BiblioNexus could not exist without continued generous support from the community.
                We would like to take this opportunity to thank our project sponsors as well as our
                donors. If you are interested in sponsoring a project, or if you wish to make a
                donation to advance the BiblioNexus mission, please reach out to
                donorrelations@biblionexus.org.
            </p>
