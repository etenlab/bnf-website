            <p>
                This code of conduct applies to all spaces the BiblioNexus Foundation manages,
                including IRC, public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs,
                Twitter, and any other communication channels our communities use. A code of conduct
                which is specific to in-person events (ie., conferences) is in the BNF
                anti-harassment policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                We expect everyone who participates in the BNF community formally or informally, or
                claims any affiliation with the BNF, in any BNF-related activities and especially
                when representing the BNF in any role to honor this code of conduct.
            </p>
            <p>
                This code is not exhaustive or complete. It distills our common understanding of a
                collaborative, shared environment and goals.We expect all members of the BNF
                community to follow it in spirit as much as in the letter, so that it can enrich all
                of us and the technical communities in which we participate.
            </p>
            <h2 id='specific-guidelines'>Specific Guidelines</h2>
            <p>We strive to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Be open. We invite anyone to participate in our community. We prefer to use
                        public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless
                        discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or
                        project-related support, too; not only is a public support request much more
                        likely to result in an answer to a question, it also makes sure that the
                        community notices and corrects any inadvertent mistakes people answering the
                        query may make.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient. We work together to resolve
                        conflicts, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic
                        fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do
                        not allow frustration to result in a personal attack. A community where
                        people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We should
                        be respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with
                        people outside our community.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Be collaborative. Other people will use our work, and we in turn depend on
                        the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the project,
                        we are willing to explain to others how it works, so they can build on the
                        work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect users and
                        colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making decisions.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many
                        problems later, so we encourage questions, although we may redirect them to
                        the appropriate Slack channel. Those who receive a question should be
                        responsive and helpful, within the context of our shared goal of improving
                        Apache project code.
                    </p>
                </li>

                    <p>
                        Be careful in the words that we choose. Whether we are participating as
                        professionals or volunteers, we value professionalism in all interactions,
                        and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult
                        or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour
                        are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
                    </p>

                            such as IRC channel history. * Personal insults, especially those using

                            unnecessary profanity. * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if

                    <p>
                        Be concise. Keep in mind that, over time, hundreds or thousands of people
                        will read what you write. Writing a short Slack message means people can
                        understand the conversation as efficiently as possible. Short Slack messages
                        should always strive to be empathetic, welcoming, friendly and patient. When
                        a long explanation is necessary, consider adding a summary at the top of the
                        message.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Try to bring new ideas to a conversation so that each message adds something
                        unique to the thread, keeping in mind that the rest of the thread still
                        contains the other messages with arguments that have already been made.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly
                        long.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Step down considerately. Members of every project come and go. When somebody
                        leaves or disengages from the project they should tell people they are
                        leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where
                        they left off. In doing so, they should remain respectful of those who
                        continue to participate in the project and should not misrepresent the
                        project&quot;s goals or achievements. Likewise, community members should
                        respect any individual&quot;s choice to leave the project.

            <h2 id='diversity-statement'>Diversity Statement</h2>
            <p>
                BiblioNexus welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to
                being a community that everyone feels good about joining. Although we may not be
                able to satisfy everyone, we will always work to treat everyone well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, BNF development takes place in
                English.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Code of Conduct, above, details our standards for behavior in the BNF community.
                We expect participants in our community to meet these standards in all their
                interactions and to help others to do so.
            </p>
            <h2 id='reporting-guidelines'>Reporting Guidelines</h2>
            <p>
                While all participants should adhere to this code of conduct, we recognize that
                sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of some of the code&apos;s
                guidelines. When that happens, you may reply to them and point out this code of
                conduct. Such messages may be in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate.
                However, regardless of whether the message is public or not, it should still adhere
                to the relevant parts of this code of conduct; in particular, it should not be
                abusive or disrespectful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assume good faith; it is more likely that participants are unaware of their bad
                behavior than that they intentionally try to degrade the quality of the discussion.
                Should there be difficulties in dealing with the situation, you may report your
                compliance issues in confidence to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>CEO of BiblioNexus: John Hanger (john dot hanger at biblionexus dot org)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If the violation is in documentation or code, for example word choice within
                official documentation, report these privately to the project in question, and, if
                you have sufficient ability within the project, resolve or remove the concerning
                material, being mindful of the perspective of the person originally reporting the
                issue.
