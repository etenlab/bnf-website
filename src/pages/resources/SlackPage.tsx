            <p>
                The BiblioNexus Foundation has a workspace on Slack to provide channels on which
                people working on the same BNF project, or in the same area of the BNF, can discuss
                issues, solve problems, and build community in real-time.
            </p>
            <p>
                A thread in a Slack channel can be a great place to work through a knotty question
                and move toward consensus. However, coming to agreement about something on Slack
                does not mean the PMC has agreed to or approved something. All formal PMC decisions
                should take place in one of the project&apos;s Slack channels, so we all have an
                audit trail of who decided what, and when.
            </p>
            <p>To be invited to the BNF Slack, please email development at biblionexus dot org.</p>
