                This page provides an overview of everything you always wanted to know about the
                BiblioNexus Foundation but were afraid to ask: the difference between membership and
                committership, who decides what, how elections take place, how our infrastructure is
                set up, what the board is and does, and what a PMC is. Come and see behind the
                scenes of the BNF.

            <p>
                BiblioNexus is a 501(c)3 non-profit public charity organization incorporated in the
                United States of America. It was formed in 2023 primarily to serve the digital
                product development needs of the Bible translation movement.

            <h2 id='structure'>BOARD OF DIRECTORS (BOARD)</h2>
            <p>
                The board is responsible for management and oversight of the business and affairs of
                the corporation in accordance with the foundation Bylaws. This includes management
                of the corporate assets (funds, intellectual property, trademarks, and support
                equipment) and allocation of corporate resources to projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The board of directors is also able to impose technical restrictions and
                requirements on PMCs to ensure all projects within BNF are in alignment with the
                overall purpose of the BNF, which is to accelerate Bible translation through
                excellence in digital products.
            </p>
            <p>
                The board is currently composed of three individuals, one of which represents the
                ETEN subcommitte on acceleration. The bylaws don&apos;t specify the number of board
                members that the foundation should have, but this was the number of the first board
                and it has not yet been changed. The board is elected every year.
            </p>
            <p>The board website has more information and the list of the current directors.</p>

            <h3 id='board'>PROJECT MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES (PMC)</h3>
            <p>
                The Board establishes Project Management Committees (PMCs) to be responsible for the
                active management of one or more specific communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each PMC includes at least one officer of the BNF, who shall be designated its
                chair, and may include one or more other members of the BNF.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Board appoints the chair of the PMC, who also becomes an officer (Vice
                President) of the BNF. The chair has primary responsibility to the Board, and has
                the power to establish rules and procedures for the day to day management of the
                communities for which the PMC is responsible, including the composition of the PMC
                itself. See further discussion about the role of the PMC chair and why chairs are
                officers.
            </p>
            <p>The BNF Bylaws (section 6.3) define a PMC and the position of chair.</p>
            <p>
                The role of the PMC from a Foundation perspective is oversight. The main role of the
                PMC is not code and not coding, but to ensure that its community addresses all legal
                issues and follows stated procedures, and that each and every release is the product
                of the community as a whole. That is key to our litigation-protection mechanisms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second role of the PMC is to further the long-term development and health of the
                community as a whole, and to ensure that balanced and wide scale peer review and
                collaboration takes place. Within the BNF we worry about any community which centers
                around a few individuals who are working virtually without review. We believe that
                this is detrimental to quality, stability, and robustness of both code and long-term
                social structures.
            </p>
            <p>
                We firmly believe in hats. Your role at the BNF is one assigned to you personally,
                and is bestowed on you by your peers. It is not tied to your job or current employer
                or company.
            </p>
            <p>
                However those on the PMC are held to a higher standard. The PMC, and the chair in
                particular, are the eyes and ears of the BNF Board, so we rely on and need to trust
                you to provide legal oversight.
            </p>
            <p>The board can terminate a PMC at any time by resolution.</p>
            <p>
                The BiblioNexus Developer Information pages have more details of how PMCs work. A
                complete list of all BNF projects is also available.
            </p>

            <h3 id='officers'>Officers</h3>
            <p>
                The officers of BiblioNexus oversee the day-to-day affairs of the Foundation. The
                Board of Directors elects these officers.
            </p>
            <h2 id='roles'>ROLES</h2>
            <p>
                The meritocracy typically has various roles within each individual BNF project
                community:
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>
                    <a href='#users'>user</a> | <a href='#developers'>contributor</a> |{' '}
                    <a href='#committers'>committer</a>| <a href='#pmc-members'>PMC member</a> |{' '}
                    <a href='#pmc-chair'>PMC chair</a> | <a href='#bnf-members'>BNF member</a>
                </code>
            </p>
            <h3 id='users'>User</h3>
            <p>
                A user is someone who uses our software. They contribute to BNF projects by
                providing feedback to developers in the form of bug reports and feature suggestions.
                Users participate in the BNF community by helping other users on public support
                forums.
            </p>
            <h3 id='developers'>Contributor</h3>
            <p>
                A contributor is a user who contributes to a project in the form of code,
                documentation, designs, media, or any other useful artifact. They take extra steps
                to participate in a project, are active on the developer mailing list, participate
                in discussions, and provide patches, documentation, suggestions, and criticism.
                Contributors are also known as developers when their contributions are in program
                code.
            </p>
            <p>Contributors must first sign a CLA before joining a BNF project.</p>
            <h3 id='committers'>Committer</h3>
            <p>
                A committer is a developer who has write access to the code repository and has a
                signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file. Not needing to depend on other
                people to make patches to the code or documentation, they are actually making
                short-term decisions for the project. The PMC can (even tacitly) agree and approve
                the changes into permanency, or they can reject them. Remember that the PMC makes
                the decisions, not the individual committers.
            </p>
            <h3 id='pmc-members'>PMC Member</h3>
            <p>
                A PMC member is a committer who was elected due to merit for the evolution of the
                project. They have write access to the code repository, a biblionexus.org email
                address, the right to vote on community-related decisions and the right to propose
                other active contributors for committership. The PMC as a whole is the group that
                controls the project, nobody else. In particular, the PMC must vote to approve any
                formal release of their project&apos;s software products.
            </p>
            <h3 id='pmc-chair'>PMC Chair</h3>
            <p>
                The Board appoints the Chair of a PMC from the PMC members. The PMC as a whole is
                the group that controls and leads the project. The Chair is the interface between
                the Board and the Project. PMC Chairs have specific duties.
            </p>
            <h3 id='bnf-members'>BNF Member</h3>
            <p>
                A BNF member is a person who was nominated by current members and elected due to
                merit for the evolution and progress of the foundation. Members care for the BNF
                itself, usually through project-related and cross-project activities. Legally, a
                member is a &quot;shareholder&quot; of the foundation, one of the owners. They have
                the right to elect the board, to stand as a candidate for board election and to
                propose a committer for membership. They also have the right to propose a new
                project for incubation (we&apos;ll see later what this means). The members
                coordinate their activities through their mailing list and through their annual
                meeting. We have a full listing of BiblioNexus Members.
            </p>

            <h3 id='sponsor'>SPONSOR</h3>
            <p>
                Sponsors contribute resources to begin or maintain a project. They may, at the
                discretion of the board of directors, be appointed as a PMC member.
            </p>

            <h3 id='donor'>DONOR</h3>
            <p>
                Donors contribute resources directly to BiblioNexus to provide for the ongoing needs
                of the BNF as a whole.
            </p>

            <h2 id='management'>Project Management and collaboration</h2>
            <p>
                BNF projects are managed using a collaborative, consensus-based process. We do not
                have a hierarchical structure; rather, different groups of contributors have
                different rights and responsibilities in the organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the appointed PMCs have the power to create their own self-governing rules
                within the limits placed by the board of directors, there is no single vision on how
                PMCs should run their projects and nurture the communities they lead.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the same time, while there are some differences, there are a number of
                similarities all BNF projects share:
            </p>
            <h3 id='communication'>Communication</h3>
            <p>
                Communication is via the official BNF Slack workspace where conversations happen
                both synchronously via chat and asynchronously via sticky posts.
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, asynchronous communication is important because it allows archives to be
                created and it&apos;s more tolerant of the volunteer nature of the various
                communities.
            </p>
            <h3 id='documentation'>Documentation</h3>
            <p>
                Each project is responsible for its own project website. Further information to
                assist committers, developers, and PMCs is available at BNF Infrastructure.
            </p>
            <h3 id='decision-making'>Decision Making</h3>
            <p>
                Projects are normally auto governing and driven by the people who volunteer for the
                job. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;do-ocracy&quot; -- power of those who
                do. This functions well in most cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                When coordination is required, projects make decisions with a lazy consensus
                approach: a few positive votes with no negative vote is enough to get going.
            </p>
            <p>Voting is by numbers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>+1 -- a positive vote</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>0 -- abstain, have no opinion</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>-1 -- a negative vote</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The rules require that a PMC member registering a negative vote must include an
                alternative proposal or a detailed explanation of the reasons for the negative vote.
            </p>
            <p>
                The community then tries to gather consensus on an alternative proposal that can
                resolve the issue. In the great majority of cases, the concerns leading to the
                negative vote can be addressed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This process is called &quot;consensus gathering&quot; and we consider it a very
                important indication of a healthy community.
            </p>
            <p>Specific cases have some more detailed voting rules.</p>
            <h2 id='philosophy'>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                The BiblioNexus Foundation has been modeled after The Apache Software Foundation
                (ASF). As such, we borrow their “Apache Way” principles and make them our own. While
                there is not an official list, people often cite these six principles as the core

                All BNF projects share these principles. Similarly, BNF projects must govern
                themselves independently of undue commercial influence.
            </p>
            <h2 id='operation'>Operation</h2>
            <p>
                BiblioNexus has a paid staff that steward the administrative functions required for
                the BNF to operate. BiblioNexus is supported by Donors who provide the necessary
                resources for the overhead of the BNF to be covered. At the project level, BNF
                projects may be supported by Sponsors of various types who may choose to support
                some or all categories of a BNF project’s needs. These needs include server
                resources, 3rd party contractors like design or marketing, as well as the salary
                needs of Contributors.
            </p>
            <p>
                All participants in BNF projects are volunteers and nobody (not even members or
                officers) is paid directly by the BNF to do their job within the context of the
                projects. There are many examples of committers who are paid to work on projects,
                but never by the foundation itself. Rather, companies or institutions that use the
                software and want to enhance it or maintain it provide the salary.
            </p>
            <p>
                The BNF does contract out various services, including accounting, Press and Media
                relations, and infrastructure system administration.
            </p>

            <h3 id='hats'>Individuals compose the BNF</h3>
            <p>
                All of the BNF including the board, the officers, the committers, and the members,
                are participating as individuals. That is one strength of the BNF: personal
                affiliations do not cloud the person&apos;s contributions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unless they specifically state otherwise, whatever a BNF participant posts on any
                Slack channel is done as themselves. It is the individual point-of-view, wearing
                their personal hat and not as a mouthpiece for whatever company happens to be
                signing their paychecks right now, and not even as a director of the BNF.
            </p>
            <p>
                All BNF participants implicitly have multiple hats, especially the Board, the
                officers, and the PMC chairs. They sometimes need to talk about a matter of policy,
                so to avoid appearing to be expressing a personal opinion, they will state that they
                are talking in their special capacity. However, most of the time this is not
                necessary: personal opinions work well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some people declare their hats by using a special footer to their email, others
                enclose their statements in special quotation marks, others use their
                biblionexus.org email address when otherwise they would use their personal one. This
                last method is not reliable, as many people use their biblionexus.org address all of
                the time.
            </p>
            <h3 id='confidential'>Balancing confidentiality and public discussion</h3>
            <p>
                We endeavor to conduct as much discussion in public as possible. This encourages
                openness, provides a public record, and stimulates the broader community.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, sometimes private Slack channels are necessary. You must never divulge
                information from such a Slack channel in public without the express permission of
                each member of the channel. Also never copy a chat between private and public
                channels. Such an event would go beyond the normal need for channel etiquette and
                would be a serious breach of confidence. It could have serious ramifications,
                causing unnecessary confusion and ill-informed discussion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Private channels are typically only used for matters pertaining to people as
                individuals (like voting in new committers), and legal matters that require
                confidentiality.
            </p>
            <h2 id='infrastructure'>The Foundation Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>
                The BNF does not have offices or buildings. It&apos;s only physical existence is the
                technical infrastructure that enables it to operate, and the staff.
            </p>
            <p>
                The BNF Infrastructure team, known as &quot;Infra&quot;, supports services that help
                the BNF and its projects function and flourish. Learn more.
