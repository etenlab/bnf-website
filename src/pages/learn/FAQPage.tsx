                What is “Product-market fit”?
            </h3>
            <p>
                It is generally defined as “when an entrepreneur identifies a need in the market and
                builds a solution that customers want to buy”. Applied to the BT ecosystem,
                “customers want to buy” can be replaced with “users across more than one BT
                organization embrace and use the software and recommend it to others”. Historically,
                product-market fit has been elusive for all but a few BT software products. Products
                have been built but not used. This could have been due to systemic issues (existing
                BT orgs do not dictate use of software to their employees/translation teams and thus
                differ from secular enterprise businesses), or to the radical user diversity across
                the emerging teams, or many other factors. Regardless, achieving product-market fit
                is paramount for any and all future software products if they are to accelerate AAGs
                and doing so will require the best entrepreneurial minds of BiblioNexus Studio
                coming alongside BT orgs to bring focus.

            <h3 id='how-does-the-asf-help-its-projects'>
                Will software products produced by BiblioNexus Studio be licensed as open source?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Yes, consistent with the desires of its partners and ETEN, and each product will
                become part of the open source community managed by the BiblioNexus Foundation.
            </p>

            <h3>
                If a BT org just needs supplemental resources e.g. software engineers, will
                BiblioNexus Studio be a source for such resources?
            </h3>
            <p>
                No. There are numerous staff augmentation agencies and freelance consultants that
                would be logical solutions for orgs needing supplemental resources.{' '}
            </p>

            <h3>Can a BT org second key employees to BiblioNexus Studio, if they so desire?</h3>
            <p>Yes, as non-core personnel, to work on specific projects.</p>

            <h3>Will BiblioNexus Studio second core team members to BT orgs?</h3>
            <p>
                No. A central idea behind BiblioNexus Studio is to accumulate experience and
                expertise within the core team so that it can be repeatedly leveraged with each
                additional software product that BiblioNexus Studio engages on.
            </p>

            <h3>How does BiblioNexus Studio compensate its core team members?</h3>
            <p>
                Top software talent want to work in a software-centric culture and are accustomed to
                compensation packages that include salary and stock options, along with benefits.
                BiblioNexus Studio will replace stock options with heavenly crowns, but will pay
                market salaries and offer market benefits in order to attract and retain top talent.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Given BiblioNexus Studio’s culture and business model, built to attract and retain
                top talent, what happens when a top talent resource currently working for another BT
                org applies for an open position at BiblioNexus Studio?
            </h3>
            <p>
                It is not BiblioNexus Studio’s intent to lose relational capital with BT orgs by
                recruiting away key resources. Accordingly, BiblioNexus Studio will not entertain
                any interest from such talent unless and until the individual has already
                communicated their intent to exit the BT org and is in active pursuit of other
                opportunities.
            </p>

            <h3>Is a BT org required to use BiblioNexus Studio?</h3>
            <p>No.</p>

            <h3>
                Is BiblioNexus Studio required to engage with every BT org requesting assistance?
            </h3>
            <p>
                No. The BiblioNexus Studio bias will always be to engage, but certain project types
                may not be a good fit, in which case BiblioNexus Studio will say “no” and do its
                best to connect the BT org with other potentially useful resources/consultants/orgs.
            </p>

            <h3>
                What are the growth goals for BiblioNexus Studio in terms of revenue and number of
                employees?
            </h3>
            <p>
                BiblioNexus Studio’s focus will be on quality of work, not quantity, with the most
                important metric being AAG impact. Growth in the number of clients and number of
                products launched/supported will be the logical outcome of strong execution against
                the mission, but BiblioNexus Studio will not be driven by or motivated by revenue
                growth
            </p>

            <h3>
                Will BiblioNexus Studio supplement its core team with additional employees and/or
                contract resources, based on specific products/projects?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Yes. BiblioNexus Studio will engage consultants and freelancers in order to scale
                resources as needed.
