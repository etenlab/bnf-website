                Yes, the ASF is a membership-based corporation registered in Delaware, United
                States. It is a registered non-profit charity, and has received 501(c)(3) status
                from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. However, even if something happens that
                changes that status, the ASF is still a not-for-profit enterprise.

                As a corporate entity, the Apache Software Foundation is able to be a party to
                contracts, such as for technical services or guarantee-bonds for conferences. It can
                also accept donations on behalf of its projects, clarify any associated tax issues,
                and create additional self-funded services via community building activities, such
                as Apache-related T-shirts and user conferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, the Foundation provides a framework for limiting the legal exposure of
                individual volunteers while they work on behalf of one of ASF projects. In the past,
                these volunteers were personally vulnerable to lawsuits, whether legitimate or
                frivolous, which impaired many activities that might have significantly improved
                contributions to the projects and benefited our users.

            <p>
                As an officer of the corporation, PMC Chairs act on behalf of the corporation
                providing for their project the oversight that the ASF requires.Since the officer is
                acting on behalf of the corporation, there is no personal liability -- standard
                corporate assumption of liability occurs. If the officer was not acting in
                accordance with their stated role, then they would be personally liable.Since the
                ASF assumes liability, it responds on behalf of individual projects when there are
                complaints or even legal action.
            </p>
            <p>
                Officers and members are further indemnified in accordance with our bylaws (meaning
                we also take care of their legal expenses if they are sued due to their role&apos;s
                actions). In essence, PMC chairs must be officers because the board can only
                delegate things to employees or officers. It is impossible to delegate authority to
                someone who has no authority.

                All software developed within the Foundation belongs to the ASF, and therefore the
                members. The members own the code and the direction of it and the Foundation.
                Committers work on their project&apos;s code; good committers become ASF members and
                thus share the ownership of the software and the Foundation&apos;s decision-making.

                member, you must first be actively contributing to one or more of the

            <p>
                If you have sent us mail because you saw a page saying &apos;It Worked!&apos; (or
                something similar indicating that the Apache HTTP server has been installed) on your
                screen when you visit a web site, go back and <strong>READ</strong> the page. It
                should explain what is going on. The page is the equivalent of a demo or the ReadMe
                file from a Windows application installation; it is intended for the person who
                installed the software and is supposed to show that the installation completed
                successfully. The problem you are experiencing has nothing to do with us, and we
                cannot help you. You need to contact the Webmaster for the site. If the site is
                <a href='http://www.foo.com'>www.foo.com</a>, for instance, try sending mail to
                <code>webmaster@foo.com</code>. If it&apos;s
                <a href='http://www.toddsbeer.org'>www.toddsbeer.org</a>, send mail to
                <code>webmaster@toddsbeer.org</code>. And so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some older versions of the &apos;It Worked!&apos; page (supplied with older versions
                of the software) don&apos;t say that, or are mysterious or ambiguous. What they
                <em>should</em>
                say, and what the recent versions say, is something like this!

                If you sent your message because your intrusion detection reported an attack on your
                system and you clicked on the name or IP address of the attacking system, please use
                the Whois (if it reported a name) or the ARIN (if it reported an address) databases
                to locate the actual owner of the system. These databases are the authoritative ones
                for the Internet.

            <p>
                If you have sent us mail because you think you have traced spam to a system that
                displays the &apos;It Worked!&apos; page, or another page indicating that Apache is
                running on the system, the same advice applies: it is not our system; they are just
                using web software we develop and distribute for free. The web software has nothing
                to do with email or spam, it&apos;s just running on the same system. Apache has as
                much to do with email as Tetris does, and assuming we&apos;re responsible in any way
                for the spam is as reasonable as blaming Microsoft and Microsoft Excel because
                someone used Netscape to send you a nasty message. We are not and can not be
                responsible for their activity. Internet databases such as ARIN or Whois will help
                you find out who actually owns the systems, domains, and/or IP addresses involved.
