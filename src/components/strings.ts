export const about = `As it became apparent to the ETEN steering commitee that progress towards the All Access Goals (AAGs) was not on track to be met by 2033, an initiative was created to research and develop methods to accelerate Bible translation. One result of that effort was the creation of the BiblioNexus Foundation (BNF). The BNF is a not-for-profit organization the seeks to help Bible translation organizations collaborate more effectively within the software development lifecycle. The BNF is not a funding agency and does not make funding recommendations. The BNF is structured so that organizations can move projects under the BNF brand to help engender wider collaboration within the Bible translation movement and open source community.
